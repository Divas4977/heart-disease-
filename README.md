Requirements:

Python 2.7 (not compatible with Python 3.x)

TensorFlow 1.x (tested with TensorFlow 1.0)

1. Installation
First, ensure TensorFlow 1.x is installed:

text
pip install tensorflow==1.0
2. Download Pre-trained Model
Download the YOLO Tiny pre-trained model:

yolo_tiny.ckpt Download

Place the downloaded yolo_tiny.ckpt file in the directory:

text
models/pretrain/
3. Dataset Preparation (PASCAL VOC 2007)
Download the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset:

text
wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
Extract both archives into a folder named VOCdevkit:

text
tar xvf VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
tar xvf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
The directory structure should look like:

text
VOCdevkit/
 ├─ VOCcode/
 ├─ VOC2007/
 └─ ... (other folders)
Link the dataset into your project:

text
cd data
ln -s $VOCdevkit VOCdevkit2007
(Using a symlink allows you to reuse the dataset across projects.)

4. Data Preprocessing
Convert the Pascal VOC data to the required TFRecord format:

text
python tools/preprocess_pascal_voc.py
5. Training
Edit your training config as needed (conf/train.cfg), then start training with:

text
python tools/train.py -c conf/train.cfg
Training on Custom Data
Convert your own data to the required tfrecord format (similar to Pascal VOC).

Create a new configuration file with your dataset and model parameters.

Start training:

text
python tools/train.py -c your_custom_config.cfg
6. Run Demo/Test
To run detection on a demo image or video:

text
python demo.py
Note:

This codebase is only compatible with Python 2.7 and TensorFlow 1.x.

For modern projects, consider TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch-based YOLO versions.

> Data Set Information:

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

Machine Learning Workflow
We explored heart disease prediction using five common ML algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Naive Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

We further enhanced the predictive accuracy by tuning these models and adjusting their parameters.

Dataset Information
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease

Original Creators:

Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.

University Hospital, Zurich: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
